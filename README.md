👋 Hi, welcome to the rabbit hole!


I am a Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) currently in Colorado, USA. I travel quite a bit and split my time between being a digital nomad and enjoying Colorado. Apart from teaching Microsoft Azure classes, I can be found consulting or supporting my customers at a software company. My passion is to find ways to automate the day to day, and free myself and colleagues up for more important things. I love to teach and travel.

If you are looking to study Azure and working on your certifications, check out this Telegram Azure Study Group https://t.me/studygroupazure 

I am a seasoned professional and Military Veteran with 19+ years of IT management and technical support experience in various sectors. I have worked mostly with Managed Service Providers in the legal, financial, and energy vectors. I am currently diving into DevOps and Kubernetes to provide SaaS at a global software company.

I was instilled with a drive to learn and to help others. I grandfather established the first computer program at the local community college where I grew up. I later was in the same program. I went on to join the U.S. Navy where I was an IT instructor amoung other things. More recently I have become a Microsoft Certified Trainer and specialize in Azure. 

When I am not diving down the rabbit hole that is IT, I like to explore nature and enjoy photography. If you are interested check out the Photography page here for some of my photos.
