ðŸ‘‹ Hi, welcome to the rabbit hole!

I am a seasoned professional and Military Veteran with 17+ years of IT management and technical support experience in various sectors. I have worked mostly with Managed Service Providers in the legal, financial, and energy vectors. I am currently diving into DevOps and Kubernetes to provide SaaS at a global software company.

I was instilled with a drive to learn and to help others. I grandfather established the first computer program at the local community college where I grew up. I later was in the same program. I went on to join the U.S. Navy where I was an IT instructor amoung other things. More recently I have become a Microsoft Certified Trainer and specialize in Azure. 

When I am not diving down the rabbit hole that is IT, I like to explore nature and enjoy photography. If you are interested check out the Photography page here for some of my photos.

ðŸ‘€ You can catch me blogging about Azure or Microsoft 365 @ http://randybordeaux.com
