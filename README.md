ðŸ‘‹ Hi, welcome to the rabbit hole!

I am a seasoned professional and Military Veteran with 17+ years of IT management and technical support experience in various sectors. I have worked mostly with Managed Service Providers in the legal, financial, and energy vectors.
I have a drive to learn and enjoy sharing knowledge which leads me to this blog.
When I am not diving down the rabbit hole that is IT, I like to explore nature and enjoy photography. If you are interested check out the Photography page here for some of my photos.

ðŸ‘€ You can catch me blogging about Azure or Microsoft 365 @ http://randybordeaux.com
